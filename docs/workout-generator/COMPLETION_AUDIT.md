# Canonical workout generator completion audit

Audit date: 2026-07-26

## Outcome

The canonical v1 implementation slice is complete behind
`CANONICAL_WORKOUT_GENERATOR_ENABLED`. It does not replace or mutate the legacy
generator. Production enablement still depends on applying migrations, publishing
a reviewed library release, and completing the human coach pilot described in the
rollout plan.

## Executable evidence

- Both deterministic and AI-assisted routes load the same published canonical
  release and invoke the same deterministic generator.
- The AI layer uses schema-constrained structured output and is prohibited from
  returning exercise IDs or prescriptions. Ambiguity and contradictions fail
  closed; service failure falls back to structured deterministic input.
- Publication gates exclude draft, incomplete, and video-incomplete cards.
- Hard filters cover explicit avoids, movement/body-region limits, equipment
  availability and quantity, environment/space, age/training age, cohort
  scaling, difficulty/risk, impact, modifier compatibility, and coach capacity.
- Phase planning, seeded selection, family diversity, contextual delivery
  profiles, dose, cohort challenge, station logistics, duration reconciliation,
  validation, and bounded impact-dose repair are deterministic and traceable.
- Every saved result carries schema, generator, library, rule, seed, intent,
  validation, diagnostics, repair, and quality versions/evidence.
- The evaluator returns all 38 required categories as 1-100 or explicit
  not-applicable values and enforces the hard-constraint ceiling.
- Coach review, athlete-feedback storage, privacy-conscious AI audit, and
  facility/library quality reporting are defined in migration 242 and the
  telemetry module.
- The coach UI exposes structured and AI-assisted input plus coach/athlete
  result views, assumptions, rationale, validation, and diagnostics.
- Canonical card governance provides optimistic-concurrency drafts, immutable
  revisions, version-bound two-person review, exact-match media verification,
  lifecycle publication gates, and reviewed relationship edges. See
  `CARD_GOVERNANCE.md` and migration 243.
- Canonical cards now carry structured anatomy, plane, laterality, external-load,
  impact-contact, and fatigue/recovery profiles. These fields feed publication
  readiness, workout prescriptions, impact budgets, coverage scoring, and the
  data-quality report. See migration 244.
- Coaches can request only reviewed graph substitutions; every swap is
  re-prescribed, revalidated against the complete workout, rescored, traced, and
  persisted as a new immutable generated-workout record.
- AI-assisted card authoring is schema constrained and quarantined: confidence
  is capped, production-authority fields are rejected, prompts are not retained,
  and drafts remain unsaved until a human explicitly saves and reviews them.
- The calibration workspace supports reviewed 20/40/60/80 score anchors with
  independent approval and supersession history. Technical complexity and
  physical difficulty are calibrated independently; overall difficulty is
  derived as their maximum and cannot receive a new independent calibration.
  Migrations 245 and 304 store the audit trail without mutating published
  cards.
- Deterministic selection projects cumulative grip, local-muscle, spinal,
  eccentric, impact, and technical-sensitivity costs before accepting a
  candidate. Final validation and reviewed swaps independently enforce the same
  budgets. See `CALIBRATION_AND_FATIGUE.md`.
- Migration 246 and the canonical library audit produce and persist a named
  automated test packet for every migrated exercise. The measured baseline is
  1,673/1,673 legacy sources mapped into 1,555 canonical definitions, all
  honestly quarantined and none published. See `LIBRARY_AUDIT.md`.
- Generated workouts include distinct coach and athlete projections. The coach
  projection retains logistics, budgets, quality gates, substitutions, and
  coaching detail; the athlete projection contains concise execution and stop
  guidance without internal diagnostics.
- Migration 248 and `canonicalReferenceCard.js` extend cards with sequencing,
  interference, effective and weekly dose, prerequisites, progression criteria,
  complete time models, scaling, measurement, coach decision support, member
  accessibility and pain guidance, and support/change-impact operations. See
  `PRODUCTION_REFERENCE_CARD.md`.

## Verification

On 2026-07-26:

- 762 platform Node tests ran: 742 passed, 20 integration-environment tests
  skipped intentionally, and none failed. This includes all 25 named golden
  scenarios and the governance, graph-swap, AI-quarantine, anatomy/load,
  difficulty-model, and telemetry suites,
- a 7,000-card deterministic generation test completed in under the five-second
  release ceiling,
- the complete migration chain passed on disposable PostgreSQL,
- all 1,673 legacy exercise sources were audited through their 1,555 active
  canonical definitions, and every active definition remains quarantined
  pending human review,
- the production reference card passed a real repository save/load round trip
  while its missing-media publication gate remained active,
- 118 redundant definitions were consolidated into canonical identities while
  preserving 1,673 source variants, 1,717 delivery profiles, and all legacy
  source mappings; direct identity collisions are now zero.
- Focused ESLint passed for the canonical backend, route, and coach UI files.
- `npm run build` completed successfully.
- The complete migration sequence through migration 308 and every add-on was
  applied successfully from a blank disposable PostgreSQL 15 database.
  Migrations 304 and 305 were also applied through the normal runner and
  directly rerun; the final migration-305 rerun performed zero inserts and zero
  updates. Migration 306 was applied in both the fresh-chain rehearsal and the
  working audit database, then directly rerun idempotently in the latter. An
  isolated clone with a synthetic human-reviewed duplicate record proved that
  migration 306 aborts before reassignment or archival instead of overriding
  review history.
- Migration 307 was applied through the normal runner on both the fresh-chain
  rehearsal and working review databases, then directly rerun twice
  idempotently in the rehearsal. An isolated clone with a synthetic
  human-reviewed Cossack record proved that it aborts before any reassignment or
  archival. The temporary clone was removed after the guard test.
- Migration 308 was applied through the normal runner in the working review
  database and to the fresh-chain rehearsal, then directly rerun twice
  idempotently. An isolated clone with a synthetic approved calibration proved
  that it aborts before reassigning or archiving adductor rock-back records. The
  temporary clone was removed after the guard test.
- Migration 305 used traceable legacy difficulty profiles to populate physical
  difficulty for 287 previously incomplete variants and mechanically derived
  overall difficulty for every supported variant. The resulting coverage is
  1,661/1,673 variants with consistent technical, physical, and derived-overall
  scores. The 12 variants with no source assessment remain in `review` with
  explicit quarantine provenance; no score approval or publication was
  created. The migration fails closed rather than changing a published variant,
  current approved card review, or approved score record.
- Deterministic repeat tests use deep equality with the same seed.
- All 205 canonical-research JSON artifacts pass the exercise-difficulty
  invariant. The normalization tool corrected 278 historical candidate-summary
  overall scores across 164 files so overall now equals the greater of
  technical complexity and physical or absolute-load demand; non-core
  dimensions remain separately available to planning.
- Golden quality evaluation is at least 90/100 with safety and logistics at
  100/100.

## Operational release gates

These are deployment and evidence gates, not code-completion claims:

1. Apply the complete migration sequence through migration 308 in a
   non-production environment.
2. Run the full library audit; review anatomy, constraints, scores, media,
   relationships, and calibration evidence card by card.
3. Publish a versioned library release only from cards whose stored packet
   passes and whose independent review is current.
4. Run the documented internal-coach pilot and measure the 90% keep/minor-edit,
   sub-10% swap, and sub-15% dose-edit targets.
5. Enable the feature flag by rollout stage only after its quantitative gates
   pass. Keep the legacy path available for immediate rollback.
